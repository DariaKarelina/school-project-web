                                        As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
                                        And I can't help but to hear
                                        No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
                                        "What a beautiful wedding
                                        What a beautiful wedding", says a bridesmaid to a waiter
                                        "And, yes, but what a shame
                                        What a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore"

                                        "Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?"
                                        No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
                                        With a sense of poise and rationality
                                        I chime in
                                        "Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?"
                                        No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
