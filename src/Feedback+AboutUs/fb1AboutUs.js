                I gave you my heart
                But the very next day you gave it away
                This year

                But the very next day you gave it away

                Once bitten and twice shy
                I keep my distance
                But you still catch my eye
                Tell me baby
                Do you recognize me?
                Well
                It's been a year
                It doesn't surprise me
                "Happy Christmas"
                I wrapped it up and sent it
                With a note saying "I love you"
                I meant it
                Now I know what a fool I've been
                But if you kissed me now
                I know you'd fool me again

                Last Christmas
